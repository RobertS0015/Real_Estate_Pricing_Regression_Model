This project provides a comprehensive documentation of the development and implementation of a linear regression model designed to predict real estate prices. Our approach involves collecting and analyzing relevant housing market data, identifying key features that influence pricing, and applying linear regression techniques to establish predictive relationships. We take an iterative approach to refining our model, continuously adjusting parameters, evaluating performance metrics, and incorporating improvements until we achieve satisfactory accuracy and reliability.
